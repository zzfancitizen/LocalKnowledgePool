Token counting enables you to determine the number of tokens in a message before sending it to Claude, helping you make informed decisions about your prompts and usage. With token counting, you can

This feature is eligible for [Zero Data Retention (ZDR)](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/api-and-data-retention). When your organization has a ZDR arrangement, data sent through this feature is not stored after the API response is returned.

## How to count message tokens

The [token counting](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/messages-count-tokens) endpoint accepts the same structured list of inputs for creating a message, including support for system prompts, [tools](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/overview), [images](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/vision), and [PDFs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support). The response contains the total number of input tokens.

The token count should be considered an **estimate**. In some cases, the actual number of input tokens used when creating a message may differ by a small amount.

Token counts may include tokens added automatically by Anthropic for system optimizations. **You are not billed for system-added tokens**. Billing reflects only your content.

### Supported models

All [active models](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview) support token counting.

### Count tokens in basic messages

```
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.count_tokens(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    system="You are a scientist",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, Claude"}],
)

print(response.json())
```

```
{ "input_tokens": 14 }
```

### Count tokens in messages with tools

[Server tool](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/tool-use/server-tools) token counts only apply to the first sampling call.

```
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.count_tokens(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    tools=[
        {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather in a given location",
            "input_schema": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA",
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location"],
            },
        }
    ],
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"}],
)

print(response.json())
```

```
{ "input_tokens": 403 }
```

### Count tokens in messages with images

```
import base64
import httpx

image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/Camponotus_flavomarginatus_ant.jpg"
image_media_type = "image/jpeg"
image_data = base64.standard_b64encode(httpx.get(image_url).content).decode("utf-8")

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.count_tokens(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "image",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": image_media_type,
                        "data": image_data,
                    },
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image"},
            ],
        }
    ],
)
print(response.json())
```

```
{ "input_tokens": 1551 }
```

### Count tokens in messages with extended thinking

See [how the context window is calculated with extended thinking](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#how-context-window-is-calculated-with-extended-thinking) for more details

- Thinking blocks from **previous** assistant turns are ignored and **do not** count toward your input tokens
- **Current** assistant turn thinking **does** count toward your input tokens

```
client = anthropic.Anthropic()

response = client.messages.count_tokens(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6",
    thinking={"type": "enabled", "budget_tokens": 16000},
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Are there an infinite number of prime numbers such that n mod 4 == 3?",
        },
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "thinking",
                    "thinking": "This is a nice number theory question. Let's think about it step by step...",
                    "signature": "EuYBCkQYAiJAgCs1le6/Pol5Z4/JMomVOouGrWdhYNsH3ukzUECbB6iWrSQtsQuRHJID6lWV...",
                },
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": "Yes, there are infinitely many prime numbers p such that p mod 4 = 3...",
                },
            ],
        },
        {"role": "user", "content": "Can you write a formal proof?"},
    ],
)

print(response.json())
```

```
{ "input_tokens": 88 }
```

### Count tokens in messages with PDFs

Token counting supports PDFs with the same [limitations](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/pdf-support#pdf-support-limitations) as the Messages API.

```
import base64
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

with open("document.pdf", "rb") as pdf_file:
    pdf_base64 = base64.standard_b64encode(pdf_file.read()).decode("utf-8")

response = client.messages.count_tokens(
    model="claude-opus-4-7",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "document",
                    "source": {
                        "type": "base64",
                        "media_type": "application/pdf",
                        "data": pdf_base64,
                    },
                },
                {"type": "text", "text": "Please summarize this document."},
            ],
        }
    ],
)

print(response.json())
```

```
{ "input_tokens": 2188 }
```

## Pricing and rate limits

Token counting is **free to use** but subject to requests per minute rate limits based on your [usage tier](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/rate-limits#rate-limits). If you need higher limits, contact sales through the [Claude Console](https://platform.claude.com/settings/limits).

| Usage tier | Requests per minute (RPM) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 100 |
| 2 | 2,000 |
| 3 | 4,000 |
| 4 | 8,000 |

Token counting and message creation have separate and independent rate limits. Usage of one does not count against the limits of the other.
